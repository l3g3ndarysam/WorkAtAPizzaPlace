Repositories for Work At A Pizza Place; all files stored inside.

This repository contains my customized hacks which will work on specified game.

The game withholds a very weak defence system; thus allowing most/if not all of my files to work there.

No high-level (L7+) executor required due to the game's defence. The loadstrings will NOT be detected.

Do not run the source code in the executor, it will not work only resulting in the crashing of your Roblox Game Client.

I will put the loadstrings for the scripts into a separate text file, if some of the loadstrings are not shared you may have to ask me for them if I want to publish them, that is.
